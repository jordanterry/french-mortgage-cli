## Installation

### Quick Install

Copy the skill files to your Claude skills directory:

```bash
# Create skills directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment

# Copy skill files
cp french_mortgage.py ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment/
cp skill.json ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment/

# Make script executable (if needed)
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment/french_mortgage.py
```

### Verify Installation

Test that the skill works:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment
echo '{
  "propertyPrice": 300000,
  "downPayment": 60000,
  "interestRate": 3.5,
  "loanTermYears": 20,
  "monthlyRent": 1500,
  "holdingPeriodYears": 10
}' | python3 french_mortgage.py --json-input
```

You should see detailed JSON output with mortgage details, yearly projections, and investment summary.

## Usage with Claude

Once installed, you can ask Claude to analyze French properties naturally:

### Example Conversations

**Basic Analysis:**
> "Analyze a 300k EUR property in France with 60k down payment, 3.5% interest rate, 20-year mortgage, renting for 1500/month. I plan to hold it for 10 years."

**With Additional Parameters:**
> "Same property but with 2400 EUR annual property tax, 150 EUR monthly HOA fees, 8% management fee, 5% vacancy rate, and 2% annual rent increases."

**Comparisons:**
> "Compare this to a 250k property renting for 1300/month with a 15-year mortgage at 3% interest."

Claude will:
1. Extract the parameters from your question
2. Call the skill with appropriate JSON input
3. Parse the comprehensive output
4. Present results in a conversational format with key insights

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Found
Verify the skill is in the correct location:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment/
```

You should see:
- `french_mortgage.py`
- `skill.json`
- `README.md`

### Python Not Found
Ensure Python 3 is installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```

Should show Python 3.8 or later.

### Test Manually
If Claude can't invoke the skill, test it manually:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/french-property-investment
python3 french_mortgage.py --help
```

### Invalid JSON

```bash
echo '{"propertyPrice": 300000, "downPayment": 60000, "interestRate": 3.5, "loanTermYears": 20, "monthlyRent": 1500, "holdingPeriodYears": 10}' | python3 french_mortgage.py --json-input | python3 -m json.tool
